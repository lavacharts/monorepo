`@lavacharts/core` is the module that was developed initially in tandem with [Lavacharts](https://github.com/kevinkhill/lavacharts) but now is a fully functional frontend package. I have been learning Typescript, and it has accelerated the simplicity of re-writing the whole module into TS and add some features along the way.
